This mini project implements a dynamic backend file organization system using Node.js and Express. *)
It automatically detects the file type from the request URL, moves the requested file into its corresponding folder (such as JPG, PNG, or IMG), and serves it to the client.

The project demonstrates real-world server-side file handling, middleware routing, and file system operations such as dynamic path resolution and automated folder-based classification
