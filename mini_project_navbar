The navigation bar (navbar) is the main menu of the website that helps users move easily between different pages.
In the RR Footware website, the navbar provides quick access to important sections such as Home, Brands, About, and Contact.

It contains a dropdown menu that dynamically displays footwear brand names like Columbus, Crocss, Walkkaro, VKC, and Paragon.
These brand names are loaded from the server using Express and EJS, making the navbar flexible and easy to update.

The navbar improves user experience by giving a clear and organized way to explore products and information on the website.
